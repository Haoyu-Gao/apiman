# Apiman (Open Source API Management)

**‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è Apiman 4 is under active development ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è**

Apiman is a flexible and open-source API Management platform.

With just a few clicks, you can get Apiman running, putting a platform at your fingertips that covers the whole API Management lifecycle. Whether you want to offer existing APIs to external consumers securely or have a centralized location to discover and govern APIs, Apiman has you covered.

Apiman is designed to be easy to customize, allowing you to implement your functionality by writing simple Java plugins.

## üìñ Requirements


- Java 11+
- To build Apiman with tests: Docker or an equivalent container engine (for running tests with [testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/supported_docker_environment/))
- Naturally, if you're using an Apiman container, you'll need it for runtime too!


## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Quickstart


You can explore the [quickstarts on apiman.io](https://www.apiman.io).

Alternatively, build and run the 'server-all' quickstart to try everything out immediately. Here are the steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apiman/apiman.git && cd apiman
./fastbuild.sh
cd tools/server-all/target/docker
docker compose up -d
./wildfly-dev-server/bin/standalone.sh
```

Once Apiman has started, you can access the API Manager at [http://localhost:8080/apimanui/](http://localhost:8080/apimanui/) and log in using the following credentials:

* Username: `admin`
* Password: `admin123!`
Keycloak admin console is available at [http://localhost:8085/admin](http://localhost:8085/admin) with the same credentials.

### ‚öíÔ∏è Build Apiman
The easiest way to build quickly (without tests) is to use the [fastbuild script](https://github.com/apiman/apiman/blob/master/fastbuild.sh):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/apiman/apiman.git && cd apiman
./fastbuild.sh
```

### I want to run the tests

First, build the parent pom (located in `/parent`), and then build the main project from the top level:

```shell
echo "Building Apiman Parent..."
cd parent
../mvnw clean install

cd ..
echo "Building the main Apiman project..."
./mvnw clean install
```
